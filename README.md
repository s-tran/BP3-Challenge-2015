# BP3-Challenge-2015; Stephen Tran; The University of Texas at Austin

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-This solution is written in Java.
-The program will prompt the user and then act according to the user inputs. This means the user must give inputs as specified.
-Some assumptions/notes were made for each of the five functions.
-NOTE: Line 22 { br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/Users/Stephen/Documents/School/EE422C/EE422C Assignment WORKSPACE/bp3/task-2.json")); } must be edited to change the file location to where the .json file is located on your personal machine. (this may have been avoided with a user input but due to time constraint (due to tests/service org) I did not have time to test/implement this)
